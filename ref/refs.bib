Here we consider a complementary technique that quantitatively groups and relates proteins based on the chemical similarity of their ligands. We began with 65,000 ligands annotated into sets for hundreds of drug targets. The similarity score between each set was calculated using ligand topology. A statistical model was developed to rank the significance of the resulting similarity scores, which are expressed as a minimum spanning tree to map the sets together. Although these maps are connected solely by chemical similarity, biologically sensible clusters nevertheless emerged. Links among unexpected targets also emerged, among them that methadone, emetine and loperamide (Imodium) may antagonize muscarinic M3, α2 adrenergic and neurokinin NK2 receptors, respectively. These predictions were subsequently confirmed experimentally. Relating receptors by ligand chemistry organizes biology to reveal unexpected relationships that may be assayed using the ligands themselves.},

	                Identifying drug targets is a critical step in pharmacology. Drug phenotypic and chemical indexes are two important indicators in this field. However, in previous studies, the indexes were always isolated and the candidate proteins were often limited to a small subset of the human genome.
	                
	                Methodology/Principal Findings
	                Based on the correlations observed in pharmacological and genomic spaces, we develop a computational framework, drugCIPHER, to infer drug-target interactions in a genome-wide scale. Three linear regression models are proposed, which respectively relate drug therapeutic similarity, chemical similarity and their combination to the relevance of the targets on the basis of a protein-protein interaction network. Typically, the model integrating both drug therapeutic similarity and chemical similarity, drugCIPHER-MS, achieved an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.988 in the training set and 0.935 in the test set. Based on drugCIPHER-MS, a genome-wide map of drug biological fingerprints for 726 drugs is constructed, within which unexpected drug-drug relations emerged in 501 cases, implying possible novel applications or side effects.
	                
	                Conclusions/Significance
	                Our findings demonstrate that the integration of phenotypic and chemical indexes in pharmacological space and protein-protein interactions in genomic space can not only speed the genome-wide identification of drug targets but also find new applications for the existing drugs.},

Apart from the addition of quantitative binding data and the statistical consideration of the similarity distribution in all drug classes, new approaches were implemented to improve the target prediction. The 3D similarity as well as the occurrence of fragments and the concordance of physico-chemical properties is also taken into account. In addition, the effect of different fingerprints on the prediction was examined. The retrospective prediction of a drug class (ATC code of the WHO) allows the evaluation of methods and descriptors for a well-characterized set of approved drugs. The prediction is improved by 7.5% to a total accuracy of 75.1%. For query compounds with sufficient structural similarity, the web server allows prognoses about the medical indication area of novel compounds and to find new leads for known targets.

Chromatographic separation was obtained on a Waters ACQUITY UPLCTM BEH (ethylene bridged hybrid) C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid aqueous solution and acetonitrile under a gradient elution manner. A hybrid linear ion trap triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in negative electrospray ionization mode with multiple reactions monitoring for detection and quantification of the eight compounds. The validated method demonstrated good linearity (r2 ≥ 0.9991), precision (RSD ≤ 1.87%) and accuracy (95.16–102.11%, RSD ≤ 1.83%) for all reference analytes. The quantitative results revealed that B. ligulata contains the highest amount of the major active marker-bergenin. The results also suggest that sensitive UHPLC-QqQLIT-MS/MS method, a sensitive, accurate and convenient one, could be helpful in identification of potential accession(s), rapid quality control and establishing authenticity of Bergenia species as raw material for pharmaceutical industries.},

Typical chemopreventive compounds include components of traditional Chinese medicine, natural compounds and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Such compounds are somewhat selective but are predisposed to bind multiple protein targets distributed throughout diverse signaling pathways in human cells. In contrast to conventional virtual screening, which identifies the ligands of a targeted protein from a compound database, reverse screening is used to identify the potential targets or unintended targets of a given compound from a large number of receptors by examining their known ligands or crystal structures. This method, also known as in silico or computational target fishing, is highly valuable for discovering the target receptors of query molecules from terrestrial or marine natural products, exploring the molecular mechanisms of chemopreventive compounds, finding alternative indications of existing drugs by drug repositioning, and detecting adverse drug reactions and drug toxicity. Reverse screening can be divided into three major groups: shape screening, pharmacophore screening and reverse docking. Several large software packages, such as Schrödinger and Discovery Studio; typical software/network services such as ChemMapper, PharmMapper, idTarget, and INVDOCK; and practical databases of known target ligands and receptor crystal structures, such as ChEMBL, BindingDB, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), are available for use in these computational methods. Different programs, online services and databases have different applications and constraints. Here, we conducted a systematic analysis and multilevel classification of the computational programs, online services and compound libraries available for shape screening, pharmacophore screening and reverse docking to enable non-specialist users to quickly learn and grasp the types of calculations used in protein target fishing. In addition, we review the main features of these methods, programs and databases and provide a variety of examples illustrating the application of one or a combination of reverse screening methods for accurate target prediction.},

It is found that researchers from China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Zhejiang University, Chinese Academy of Sciences and other institutes have opened up new methods of research on TCM since 2009, with quantitative methods and knowledge presentation models. The adopted tools mainly consist of text mining, knowledge discovery, technologies of the TCM database, data mining and drug discovery through TCM calculation, etc. In the future, research on quantitative models of TCM will focus on solving the heterogeneity and incompleteness of big data of TCM, establishing standardized treatment systems, and promoting the development of modernization and internationalization of TCM.},

To overcome this problem, a classification-based methodology for simplifying TCM researches was refined from literature in the past 10 years (2011–2020). The theoretical basis of this methodology is set theory, and its core concept is classification. Its starting point is that “although TCM may contain hundreds of compounds, the vast majority of these compounds are structurally similar”. The methodology is composed by research strategies for components, metabolites and bioactivities of TCM, which are the three main parts of the review. Technical route, key steps and difficulty are introduced in each part. Two perspectives are highlighted in this review: set theory is a theoretical basis for all strategies from a conceptual perspective, and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a common tool for all strategies from a technical perspective. The significance of these strategies is to simplify complex TCM researches, integrate isolated TCM researches, and build a bridge between traditional medicines and modern medicines. Potential research hotspots in the future, such as discovery of bioactive ingredients from TCM metabolites, are also discussed. The classification-based methodology is a summary of research experience in the past 10 years. We believe it will definitely provide support and reference for the following TCM researches.},

However, there is currently no systematic database organizing these data for TCM. Therefore, we built HERB, a high-throughput experiment- and reference-guided database of TCM, with its Chinese name as BenCaoZuJian. We re-analyzed 6164 gene expression profiles from 1037 high-throughput experiments evaluating TCM herbs/ingredients, and generated connections between TCM herbs/ingredients and 2837 modern drugs by mapping the comprehensive pharmacotranscriptomics dataset in HERB to CMap, the largest such dataset for modern drugs. Moreover, we manually curated 1241 gene targets and 494 modern diseases for 473 herbs/ingredients from 1966 references published recently, and cross-referenced this novel information to databases containing such data for drugs. Together with database mining and statistical inference, we linked 12 933 targets and 28 212 diseases to 7263 herbs and 49 258 ingredients and provided six pairwise relationships among them in HERB. In summary, HERB will intensively support the modernization of TCM and guide rational modern drug discovery efforts. And it is accessible through http://herb.ac.cn/.},

	abstractnote = {De novo drug design refers to the process of designing new drug molecules from scratch using computational methods. In contrast to other computational methods that primarily focus on modifying existing molecules, designing from scratch enables the exploration of new chemical space and the potential discovery of novel molecules with enhanced properties. In this research, we proposed a model that utilizes Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture and relative attention for de novo drug design. GPT is a language model that utilizes transformer architecture to predict the next word or token in a given sequence. Representation of molecules using SMILES notation has enabled the use of next-token prediction techniques in de novo drug design. GPT uses attention mechanisms to capture the dependencies and relationships between different tokens in a sequence and allows the model to focus on the most important information when processing the input. Relative attention is a variant of the attention mechanism, which allows the model to capture the relative distances and relationships between tokens in the input sequence. In the standard attention mechanism, positional information is typically encoded using fixed-position embeddings. In relative attention, positional information is supplied dynamically during attention calculation by incorporating relative positional encodings, enabling the model to quickly learn the syntax of new unseen tokens. Relative attention enables the GPT model to better understand the relative positions of tokens in the sequence, which can be particularly useful when dealing with limited dataset sizes or generating target-specific drugs. The proposed model was trained on benchmark datasets, and performance was compared with other generative models. We show that relative attention and transfer learning could enable the GPT model to generate molecules with improved validity, uniqueness, and novelty in the context of de novo drug design. To illustrate the effectiveness of relative attention, the model was trained using transfer learning on three target-specific datasets, and the performance was compared with standard attention.},

	abstractnote = {Simultaneously, multiplexed genome engineering and targeting multiple genomic loci are valuable to elucidating gene interactions and characterizing genetic networks that affect phenotypes. Here, we developed a general CRISPR-based platform to perform four functions and target multiple genome loci encoded in a single transcript. To establish multiple functions for multiple loci targets, we fused four RNA hairpins, MS2, PP7, com and boxB, to stem–loops of gRNA (guide RNA) scaffolds, separately. The RNA-hairpin-binding domains MCP, PCP, Com and λN22 were fused with different functional effectors. These paired combinations of cognate-RNA hairpins and RNA-binding proteins generated the simultaneous, independent regulation of multiple target genes. To ensure that all proteins and RNAs are expressed in one transcript, multiple gRNAs were constructed in a tandemly arrayed tRNA (transfer RNA)-gRNA architecture, and the triplex sequence was cloned between the protein-coding sequences and the tRNA-gRNA array. By leveraging this system, we illustrate the transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, DNA methylation and DNA demethylation of endogenous targets using up to 16 individual CRISPR gRNAs delivered on a single transcript. This system provides a powerful platform to investigate synthetic biology questions and engineer complex-phenotype medical applications.},

The study demonstrated the effectiveness of using untargeted metabolomics to screen Ferula quality markers. Furthermore, based on the specific metabolites found, Mantel tests, redundancy analysis, and stepwise regression equation models were jointly affected by soil and terrain factors. These findings provide valuable insights into the rational utilisation and management of Ferula plant resources and artificial cultivation. Overall, this study provides an important contribution to understanding the metabolic differences in Ferula species from different environmental sources and can inform the development of sustainable strategies for the utilisation and management of Ferula plant resources.},

Elucidating the bioactive ingredients of Chinese medicinal materials is key to TCM modernization and new drug discovery. However, one drawback of current TCM databases is the lack of quantitative data on the constituents of Chinese medicinal materials. Herein, we present ccTCM, a web-based platform designed to provide a component and compound-content-based resource on TCM and analysis services for medical experts. In terms of design features, ccTCM combines resource distribution, similarity analysis, and molecular-mechanism analysis to accelerate the discovery of bioactive ingredients in TCM. ccTCM contains 273 Chinese medicinal materials commonly used in clinical settings, covering 29 functional classifications. By searching and comparing, we finally adopted 2043 studies, from which we collected the compounds contained in each TCM with content greater than 0.001 %, and a total of 1449 were extracted. Subsequently, we collected 40,767 compound-target pairs by integrating multiple databases. Taken together, ccTCM is a versatile platform that can be used by TCM scientists to perform scientific and clinical TCM studies based on quantified ingredients of Chinese medicinal materials. ccTCM is freely accessible at http://www.cctcm.org.cn.},
